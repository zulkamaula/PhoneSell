Allow Netlify and GitHub to talk to each other.
Clicking the Authorize Application button will do just that

Choose the repo to deploy from the list.


### Step 5: Configure Your Settings

Make sure publish directory is where public site files are placed after building the site (e.g. dist) and build command is whatever run to build the site (e.g. npm run build). 
Then click the Deploy site button to continue.


### Step 6: Build Your Site

let Netlify take care of the rest. It'll only take a minute.


### Step 7: All Done

Once the build completes, the site is live! 
Head to the overview and you can see the URL of newly published site.

Netlify automatically generated a name for site.
After updating by visit the settings tab and clicking "Change site name":
